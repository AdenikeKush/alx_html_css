# Headphones — Responsive Landing Page (No JS, No Frameworks)

A pixel-accurate, accessible, responsive landing page built **from scratch** with **only HTML & CSS**.  
Design by **Nicolas Philippot (UI/UX)**. This implementation follows the desktop, tablet, and mobile layouts provided in Figma.

> 🎯 **Goal:** Reproduce the Figma design faithfully, keep CSS simple/clean, and ensure the page switches to mobile at **≤ 480px**.
